# Data Protection, Privacy, and Bias in Data - Notes

## Key Concepts
- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual, such as biometric records, usernames, Social Security numbers, or national IDs.
- **Aggregate Information:** Data collected from a large group of users with all PII removed; protects privacy and represents broader populations.
- **Bias in Data:** Influence of human perspectives (backgrounds, beliefs, experiences) on data collection, analysis, interpretation, and communication.
- **Sample:** A subset of a population used in analytics that should reflect the overall population to provide accurate insights.

## Detailed Notes
- **Data Responsibility:**
  - Organizations must protect user data, especially **PII**, as mishandling can lead to identity theft, fraud, or misuse.
  - Communication exchanges (receipts, orders, loyalty points) generate data, contributing to privacy concerns.

- **PII Characteristics:**
  - Associated with medical, financial, and employment records.
  - Highly sensitive and requires careful management.

- **Trends in Data Practices:**
  - Shift towards using **aggregate information** instead of raw PII.
  - Aggregate data protects individuals while still enabling useful insights.
  - Larger datasets tend to represent wider populations rather than single users.

- **Bias in Data:**
  - Data gathering is human-driven, subject to **biases** from personal worldviews and experiences.
  - Bias affects communication, interpretation, and resulting business decisions.
  - Data professionals should consider:
    - Obvious bias sources.
    - Subtle, hidden biases.
    - Multiple possible interpretations of the same data insight.
  - Avoid premature conclusions; validate insights thoroughly.

- **Sampling in Analytics:**
  - **Good sample:** Reflects the characteristics of the entire population.
  - Example: Clothing sales analysis.
    - Initial observation: 80% sales were red and blue shirts in a high-growth market.
    - Deeper analysis revealed sports team championship influenced sales spike.
    - Market represented only 40% of total sales, so not fully representative.
    - Correct approach: Evaluate color preferences across all markets and over a longer period for accurate trends.

## Summary
- **PII** is highly sensitive and must be safeguarded to prevent misuse.
- Organizations are moving towards **aggregate information** to balance insight generation with privacy protection.
- **Bias** in data arises from human factors and must be accounted for in all stages of analysis.
- **Sampling** ensures insights are representative; poor samples lead to misleading conclusions.
- Careful analysis, avoidance of premature assumptions, and consideration of multiple interpretations are essential for reliable data-driven decisions.
