Data trends for the future
--------------------------

As you can already tell, data analytics is an emerging field with a wide range of exciting opportunities. And, even more exciting is the fact that big data is getting bigger. The need for people to understand, prioritize, manage, and analyze that information is not slowing down in any industry. Businesses will continue to rely on data-driven decision-making, fueled by both simple trend analyses and more complex techniques like predictive modeling and forecasting. 

Additionally, more companies are storing all of their raw data within large repositories accessible across the organization. As companies become more reliant on insights generated by this data, there will be many opportunities for data analytics professionals to use their skills and knowledge to organize that information and make it useful.

Innovative technologies
-----------------------

Innovations in accessing this data are leading to new approaches in making data interconnected—meaning that there are still new and evolving ways businesses in different industries are going to use data in the future. Technology is also ever-changing and adapting to these new needs. Because of this, there will always be exciting new tools and data solutions to explore.

Artificial intelligence will continue to have a large impact on business, helping to streamline many areas. For example, an increase in sales is understood to be a direct result of forecasting product demand. Artificial intelligence helps companies ensure warehouse supply, keep items in stock, reduce delivery time, and boost operational efficiency through automating processes.

Additionally, artificial intelligence will combine with machine learning, business intelligence, and automation to deliver more personalized services to customers.

Offering additional services will push forward innovation, bringing computer applications and the sources of stored data closer together physically. This concept is referred to as **edge computing**. By closing the gap between data and computation, speed improves. This results in greater support of real-time analytics and the automation necessary to support the increasing number of devices that are becoming linked through the [internet of things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things). 

An increasing number of data analytics tasks will be automated by creating, managing, and analyzing data in edge environments. Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems are only as equitable and inclusive as the people who create and train these systems. You will learn more about how you, as a data analytics professional, will need to take steps to ensure equity in the future. 

Key takeaways
-------------

As you progress through your career as a data analytics professional, you will need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies used across different industries. The one certainty about the future of data analytics is that an increasing amount of data will continue to be generated and that new systems and innovations will continue to be developed, allowing data professionals an opportunity to learn, grow, and develop new skills.
